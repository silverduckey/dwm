#+begin_example
git clone https://gitlab.com/vudangxyz/dwm ~/.dwm
cd ~/.dwm
sudo make clean install
#+end_example

The status bar is available through my build of slstatus.\\
If you want to start dwm using a display manager such as LightDM or SDDM
then you will have to copy the dwm.desktop file to /usr/share/xsessions.
