## Installation
```
git clone https://gitlab.com/vudangxyz/dwm ~/.dwm
cd ~/.dwm
sudo make clean install
```
The status bar is available through my build of slstatus.
If you want to start dwm using a display manager such as LightDM or SDDM then you will have to copy the dwm.desktop file to /usr/share/xsessions.
